Christopher A. Choquette-Choo is a Research Scientist on the Google DeepMind Privacy and Security team. I work on fundamental and applied research at the intersection of privacy and security and machine learning. Notable research topics are language modeling, memorization, differential privacy, auditing, and collaborative learning. My work has directly enabled several SOTA LLMs to be released, including Gemini (Pro 1.5), Gemma, and PaLM 2. I have also developed differential privacy techniques that are deployed for GBoard models, letting us train high-utility on-device models that also satisfy tight and provable DP guarantees.
